# Induction_Machine_Design
This project presents a generalized tool for the design and simulation of three-phase induction motors using Lua scripting integrated with FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics). It combines analytical electromagnetic calculations with automated FEMM geometry generation for rapid prototyping and analysis.


This Design will Work with any no of pole, phases and any type of slots(open,semi closed and closed) and any shape of slots(Stator : Trapezoidal , Rectangular , Trapezoidal curved corners, Rectanguler curved corners, user defined(you can define the dimensions)). And for Rotor slot shapes(keyhole single cage slot, keyhole double cage slot, rectangular slot, Trapezoidal Slot, Circular slot).
