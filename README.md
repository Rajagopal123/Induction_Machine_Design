# Induction_Machine_Design
This project presents a generalized tool for the design and simulation of three-phase induction motors using Lua scripting integrated with FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics). It combines analytical electromagnetic calculations with automated FEMM geometry generation for rapid prototyping and analysis.
